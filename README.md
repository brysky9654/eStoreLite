## eStoreLite

This is a simple slice of an store app that displays a list of products. The application showcases various optimizations that can be made
to improve the performance of the application. 

The application stack is:

- **FrontEnd** - A Blazor SSR (server side rendering, not to be confused with Blazor server!)  front end.
- **CatalogService** - An API that returns the list of products. It uses minimal APIs for the REST API and EntityFramework Core and PostgreSQL for data access.
